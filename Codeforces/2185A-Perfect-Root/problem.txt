Problem Statement:

A positive integer x is a perfect root if there exists an integer y such that sqrt(y) = x.
For example, 5 is a perfect root because sqrt(25) = 5.

For each test case, output n distinct perfect roots. Note that the values only need to be
distinct within each test case; you can use the same value in different test cases.

Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 20) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) — the number of perfect
roots to output.

Output:
For each test case, output n distinct perfect roots. Each perfect root x must be in the range
1 <= x <= 10^9.

Examples:

Input:
3
1
2
5
Output:
1
2 4
2 102 43 1 21

Note:
For the first test case:
  1 is a perfect root because sqrt(1) = 1.

For the second test case:
  2 is a perfect root because sqrt(4) = 2.
  4 is a perfect root because sqrt(16) = 4.
