Problem Statement:

Blackslex is designing a log-in system for Gean Dev and discovered that most users use weak
passwords.

To resolve this issue, he posed the following conditions, dependent on two variables k and x,
for all passwords. Each password is a string s of length n satisfying these properties.

  - s uses only the first k lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
  - For every pair of indices 1 <= i < j <= n such that (j - i) is divisible by x, the letters
    si and sj are different.

Find the smallest integer n such that no valid string of length n exists.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 500) — the number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers k and x (1 <= k <= 26,
1 <= x <= 15).

Output:
For each test case, output the minimal n.

3 2
1 5
Output:
